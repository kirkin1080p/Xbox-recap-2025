# Xbox Recap
*Because your console remembers everything.*

---

## Hear Ye, Hear Ye (Yes… From Your Console)

Did you hear that?  
That wasn’t the wind — **that was your console**.

Tired.  
Unappreciated.  
Absolutely **carrying your bad gaming decisions**.

At **Xbox Recap**, we translate its cries into something useful.

> Your console keeps a journal.  
> We just help it speak.

## What Does This Actually Do?

### Daily Console Journal
Your Xbox auto-writes short blog entries based on what you *actually* play —  
not what you *promise* you’ll finish.

### Year-Round Stats & Recaps
No vibes.  
No guessing.  
Just **tracked data**, updated as you play.

### Compare Yourself to Others
- Friends  
- Randoms  
- That one mate who “barely plays anymore”  

Flex responsibly. Or don’t. We’re not your squad leader.

## Why You’ll Care

Because your console remembers:
- The grind  
- The breaks  
- The phase where you only played *one game* for three weeks straight  

We turn all of that into a story worth reading.

## Notes From the Dungeon Master

- Tracking starts from first use  
- No data selling, no nonsense  
- Some stats improve when you connect your Xbox account  

This is about **stories**, not scores.
