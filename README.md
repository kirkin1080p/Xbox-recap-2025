# 🎮 **XBOX RECAP**
### *Because your console remembers everything.*

---

## 🧙 **Hear Ye, Hear Ye**
### *(Yes… From Your Console)*

Did you hear that?  
That wasn’t the wind —  
**that was your console.**

**Tired.**  
**Unappreciated.**  
Absolutely **carrying your bad gaming decisions.**

At **Xbox Recap**, we translate its cries into something useful.

> **Your console keeps a journal.**  
> *We just help it speak.*

## 📓 **What Does This Actually Do?**

### ✍️ **Daily Console Journal**
Your Xbox auto-writes short blog entries based on what you  
**actually play** — not what you *promise* you’ll finish.

Think of it as:
- A diary
- Written by your console
- That does **not** respect your excuses

---

### 📊 **Year-Round Stats & Recaps**
No vibes.  
No guessing.  

Just **properly tracked data**, updated as you play.

- Sessions
- Streaks
- Breaks you swore were “just for a day”

---

### 🆚 **Compare Yourself to Others**
Stack yourself up against:
- Friends  
- Randoms  
- That one mate who “barely plays anymore”  

**Flex responsibly.**  
Or don’t. We’re not your party leader.

---

## 🗡️ **Why You’ll Care**

Because your console remembers:

- The grind  
- The breaks  
- The phase where you only played *one game* for three weeks straight  

We turn all of that into  
**a story worth reading.**

## 🧠 **Notes From the Dungeon Master**

- Tracking starts from first use  
- No data selling, no nonsense  
- Some stats improve when you connect your Xbox account  

This is about **stories**, not scores.  
**Always has been.**
